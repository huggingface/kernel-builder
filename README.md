# kernel-builder

This repo contains a Nix package that can be used to build custom machine learning kernels for PyTorch. The kernels are built using the [PyTorch C++ Frontend](https://pytorch.org/cppdocs/frontend.html) and can be loaded from the Hub with the [kernels](https://github.com/huggingface/kernels)
Python package.

This builder is a core component of the larger kernel build/distribution system.

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

We provide a Docker image with which you can build a kernel:

```bash
# navigate to the activation directory
cd examples/activation

# then run the following command to build the kernel
docker run --rm \
    -v $(pwd):/kernelcode \
    ghcr.io/huggingface/kernel-builder:latest
```

This will build the kernel and save the output in the `build` directory in
the activation folder.
